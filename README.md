# NaturalNumberCalculator


Natural Number Calculator application Description

This is a very simple "RPN" (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator. There are
two operands, both of which always have natural number values. Direct entry
of a number is always to the bottom operand in the display. The "Clear"
button sets the bottom operand to 0. The "Swap" button exchanges the values
of the two operands. The "Enter" button copies the value of the bottom
operand to the top operand. Each operator button operates on the two operands
in their natural order as displayed in the interface (e.g., "-" subtracts the
bottom operand from the top operand), and each replaces the bottom operand
with the result of the operator and the top operand with 0; except that
division replaces the bottom operand with the quotient and the top operand
with the remainder.
